# CIT-paper-cli
Command line converter builds for [CIT-paper](https://modrinth.com/plugin/cit-paper) Minecraft plugin.

See [releases](https://github.com/solaluset/CIT-paper-cli/releases) page to download.

# Usage
Run the jar as any other:
```shell
java -jar CIT-paper-cli.jar /path/to/config.yml
```

You can specify input and output folders in the config.

The converter will also write rename YAMLs into `./renames` folder.
You need to upload them to `plugins/CIT-paper/renames` on your server for renames to work.
